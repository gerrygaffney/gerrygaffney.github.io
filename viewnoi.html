          <h1>You have been included on a Jury Roll</h1>
          <p>You have been included on the jury roll for the district of Bourke.</p>
          <p>The roll runs for <strong>one year</strong>, from </strong>April 1 2014</strong> to <strong>March 31 2015</strong>.</p>
          <p>During that time, you <strong>may</strong> be called (summoned) to serve on a jury.</p>
    

          <h1>What you need to do</h1>  

          <p>You do not have to take any action now. We recommend that you read the <a href="noibrochure.html">brochure</a> attached to this letter, which contains answers to common questions.</p>
          <h1>If you have holidays, exams or other commitments</h1>
          <p>You can <a href="inconvenient.html">let us know</a> about dates that would make it difficult for you to serve, or by calling 1300 JUROR.</p>
          <h1>If you are unable to serve</h1>
          <p>Jury service is a rewarding responsibility, and is a fundamental part of our justice system.</p>
          <p>Employers are obliged to release staff for jury service. Jurors will receive payment for their service.</p>
          <p>However, if jury service will cause undue hardship, or for people in certain jobs, you can <a href="applyremove.html">request to be removed from the jury roll</a>.</p>
          <h1>If your personal details have changed</h1>
          <p><a href="contactdetails.html">If your name or address have changed, let us know</a>.</p>
